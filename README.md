# HeatPeak Studio WebApp

Welcome to the repository of the HeatPeak Studio WebApp. This application is written using Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. Initially, the project was implemented with React and NodeJS, but it has recently been rewritten in these new languages.

## Project Description

The WebApp is associated with the HeatPeak Studio business website and is expected to include features such as an e-commerce platform and an innovative tool for playing a TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game). Currently, the project is in the early development stage, so there might be limited functionalities available.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains previous implementations of the project in React and NodeJS within the `legacy` folder. The current version is developed with Angular and Spring Boot. You will also find Dockerfiles and a `compose` (for Docker Compose) folder to simplify server management and setup. The backend communicates with a PostgreSQL instance via Docker Compose on the same machine.

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

The project implements CI/CD through an automated workflow defined in the YAML file located in the `.github/workflows` folder. This workflow streamlines the integration and deployment processes, ensuring a smooth and efficient development pipeline. Feel free to explore the workflow file for more insights into our CI/CD setup.
